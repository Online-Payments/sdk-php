# Online Payments PHP SDK

## Introduction

The Online Payments PHP SDK helps you to communicate with the Online Payments Server API. Its primary features are:

* convenient PHP wrapper around the API calls and responses:
  * marshalls PHP request objects to HTTP requests
  * unmarshalls HTTP responses to PHP response objects or PHP exceptions
* handling of all the details concerning authentication
* handling of required metadata

See the [Online Payments Developer Hub](https://github.com/Online-Payments/php/) for more information on how to use the SDK.

## Structure of this repository

This repository consists out of the following components:

1. The source code of the SDK itself: `/src` and `/lib`
2. The source code of the unit and integration tests: `/tests`

## Requirements

PHP 7.4 or above is required. In addition, to support streaming uploads, package [robtimus/multipart](https://packagist.org/packages/robtimus/multipart) is required.

## Installation via Composer

1. Initialize [Composer](https://getcomposer.org/download/) in your project, if this is not already done, by executing the following command:

    ```
    composer init
    ```

2. Add a requirement to the SDK to your `composer.json` file by executing the following command:

    ```
    composer require online-payments/sdk-php
    ```
3. Add `vendor/autoload.php` to your project, if this is not already done, by adding the following line of code:

    ```
    require __DIR__ . '/vendor/autoload.php';
    ```

## Manual installation

1. Download the latest version of the PHP SDK from GitHub. Choose the `sdk-php-x.y.z.tar.gz` file from the [releases](https://github.com/Online-Payments/sdk-php/releases) page, where `x.y.z` is the version number.
2. Add the contents of the `tar.gz` file to your project. The content of the `/src` and `/lib` folders may be combined, if this is required by the project.
3. Add all classes from the `/src` and `/lib` folders to your autoloader; all classes inside these folders are compliant with [PSR-4](http://www.php-fig.org/psr/psr-4/).

## Development and testing

1. Install [Composer](https://getcomposer.org/download/)
2. From the root of the sdk-php project, run `composer install`
3. Copy `tests/config.json.dist` to `tests/config.json` and replace the template values by actual values
4. From the root of the sdk-php project, `vendor/phpunit/phpunit/phpunit` (or just `phpunit` when it is already installed on your local machine)
